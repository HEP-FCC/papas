TODO C++ Papas Code. mar 2017

Testing/ Unit TESTS
Set up more tests for C++
Include longer test
PapasManagerTester?
is_inside?


CMAKE
Libraries comment out those not needed for Gaudi (eg python libraries)

PATH:
Revisit structure and how it links to Particle and to Track

ROOT: 
ask Pere re Makefiles
	Ongoing problem with ROOT and Xcode not working using FCCSW cmakelists
	Figure out how to get DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH properly sorted for Mac - need advise.



Package Structure & Top-level-structure
Review package structure as some parts are not quite right. PFEventdisplay may need to be moved. 
Change Makefile and Headers to match the finalised package structure eg “papas/Cluster.h” not “Cluster.h"
Still needs work on where everything should “live”  & ownership. This needs to take into account Python calls and future use in Gaudi. Its not quite right as yet.
PfEvent, PapasManager, Simulator and Reconstructor all own some key parts and some jiggling is needed, esp for  where C++ is to be used as a library.


Examples
Get Gun example to run separately

Timings/Profiling:
Make Automatic


DISPLAY code: needs some restructuring
Leave until plan for display is more concrete. Logical place to use display is Python
Display: display reconstucted particles somehow
Revisit the display code and have more concrete objects and less shared_ptrs
make map of views use enum not string

Logging:
Very rudimentary. Could use spdlog (as for pdebug)
How to make suitable to link to Gaudi logging
Check/modifiy to make suitable for parallel processing


Others
Attend to TODOs and comments in the existing code
